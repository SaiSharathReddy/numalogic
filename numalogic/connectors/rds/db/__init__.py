"""This code snippet is a loop that iterates over the files in the directory of the current
file. It checks if each file ends with "Fetcher.py" and if so, extracts the class name by
removing the ".py" extension. It then imports the module corresponding to the class and
retrieves the class object using the class name. Finally, it assigns the class object to the
CLASS_TYPE variable. This code snippet is used to dynamically import and assign class objects
based on file names."""
